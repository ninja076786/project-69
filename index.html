<p class="text-muted text-left">Also designed by Eppstein Uhen Architects, the LEED Platinum-certified Lake Mills Elementary School boasts a newly built children’s library filled with cubbies, quiet reading areas, wall cut-outs, and plenty of books as well as group activity spaces and movable furniture. This flexible learning environment benefits staff and students who can arrange the space to meet their specific learning needs. The interior design of the library reflects the natural world outside with brightly colored walls for the sky, white lighting for the clouds, winding bookshelves for the rivers, and earthy toned flooring.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-left">When the thirteen acoustic banners are raised out of the way, the Performance Hall auditorium looks like this. In other words, it'll look prettiest for acoustic occasions. Photo by Justin Turveen. The new City Performance Hall in Dallas' Arts District debuts this Friday with an evening of live music. But before the concerts and opening ceremonies, the hall's acoustics are being measured and tested. KERA's Jerome Weeks checks in with the people checking out the hall's sound. KERA radio story: The acoustics of any performance hall are key to its success. Look at -- or listen to -- the Meyerson Symphony Center. But the Meyerson was designed primarily for symphony concerts. That's what it does. The new City Performance Hall, in contrast, is at the other extreme. It will have to accommodate everything from jazz groups and lecture series to dance companies. One way it'll do that is up here, in the attic of the new hall. We're climbing over pipes and I-beams on a steeply sloping floor.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-left">STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A tour through the beautiful St. Peter’s R.C. Church with Glen Umberger, an architectural historian and manager of special projects at N.Y. Landmarks Conservancy, gives us insight into the history and the different types of architecture used throughout the years of the church’s creation and growth.

Sitting tall on the hill, St. Peter’s is called the ‘mother’ church for Staten Island Catholics. Bishop John Dubois established it in March 1839. St. Peter’s Church is the oldest of the 36 Roman Catholic parishes on Staten Island. The first Mass was celebrated in April 1839 in a local gun factory. As the space became too small and inappropriate, the land on Carroll Place became available. Father Madrano, who arrived in March 1839 from Spain, was the first St. Peter’s pastor. The land on Carroll Place was donated to the church by the New Brighton Association. It was then dedicated by Bishop John Hughes in September 1844.

The Rev. John Shanahan was the second pastor in 1845, and the third was the Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley, nephew of Elizabeth Ann Seton and future Archbishop of Baltimore. The original church burned down in the late 1890s. The new church was completed by Thanksgiving Day, 1903. It was built directly on top of the salvaged remains of the old church. The builders carefully matched the old brick with the new brick to create a seamless vision of the grand church.

The current church building was designed by the firm of Harding and Gooch in neo-Romanesque style with Gothic accents. Its construction took from 1900 to 1903.

French Gothic in style, the church's vaulted ceiling that towers high above the worshipers is so expertly constructed that no interior columns are necessary. Hence, the view from every corner of the church is unobstructed.

Many of the stained-glass windows added intense color to the cathedral-like interior, which was created at Franz Mayer & Co., a German stained glass design and manufacturing company, based in Munich, Germany, that still exists today. "The stained glass craftsmanship is truly remarkable," according to Umberger. The onyx and brass altar rail was imported from Italy, and the Stations of the Cross came from France. “The church truly has a great European feel due to all of the different countries’ imports,” said Umberger.

The Benziger family, for which Benziger Avenue was named, contributed to the main altar.

The clock tower can be seen from far away and is undoubtedly a Staten Island landmark.

St. Peter’s R.C. Church celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2014. In 2015 the Church of the Assumption and St. Paul’s R.C. Churches merged with St. Peter’s R.C. Church.

This splendid church was built to inspire and lift the Catholic congregation on Staten Island and all who entered. Indeed, it continues to do so today, especially during the Christmas season.</p>
